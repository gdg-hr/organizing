# Open Source Organization

Anyone can contribute and help organize the GDG Hampton Roads group. This is *our* group and helping is easy. Just take the following steps.

* Join the [GDG Hampton Roads](https://github.com/gdg-hr) Github organization. Remember to make your membership public so others know.
* Join the list of [watchers](https://github.com/gdg-hr/organizing/watchers) to this `organizing` repo. This will make sure you get emails on all threads.
* Talk and have fun!

# How We Use Github For Organizing

Everything here is tracked via Github issues. We also use issue labels to help filter topics. The general idea is to start an issue and talk about it.

* [All Issues](https://github.com/gdg-hr/organizing/issues?state=open)
* [Next Meetups](https://github.com/gdg-hr/organizing/issues?labels=Meetups&page=1&state=open)
* [General Ideas](https://github.com/gdg-hr/organizing/issues?labels=Ideas&page=1&state=open)
* [Outreach](https://github.com/gdg-hr/organizing/issues?labels=Outreach&page=1&state=open)
* [Prospects](https://github.com/gdg-hr/organizing/issues?labels=Prospects&page=1&state=open)

### Next Meetups

Try to make the title follow a `YEAR-MONTH-DAY Topic` naming convention if it for a specific meetup date. All communications can be recorded in this issue too both before and after the meetup. We can let each other know who is updating the copy, what notes we had about the meetup and follow-up action items. 

### General Ideas

Anything goes here. The group is constantly changing and these threads are a great way to talk about that change.

### Outreach

Whenever one of our own goes out of town and speaks, let's keep notes about it in these issue types. We can talk about our own dev swag, etc.

### Prospects

A scratch pad of people we meet and ideas for future speakers to come and talk to us.
